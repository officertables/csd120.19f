        <h1> Welcome to Owen's CSD120 Website! </h1>
        <p>I'm a student as of writing this taking Sault College's Computer Programmer course. I work at Tim Hortons on Second Line and Farwell. I spend way too much time on the bus and traveling to and from the school.</p>
    
        <p>When I have the free time, I like to play games. I play games such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, League of Legends, Destiny 2, and starting tomorrow, friday the 13th, I will be playing Borderlands 3. I play on both PC and Xbox.</p>

        A mime make a rhyme? <br>
        Sure a mime can make a rhyme,<br>
        But who would hear it?<br>
